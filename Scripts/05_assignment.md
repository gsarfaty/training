# Training Assignment 2

You've been asked to pull data and create a visual to show FY20 proxy linkage by psnu among the FSW key populations group for Kenya.

## Your job: 

* download the correct datasets (MER & geospatial)
* manipulate the MSD to create the proxy linkage metric for FY20 (full year) for FSW
* verify your values against another source (eg. Pano) to ensure they are correct
* map the data & combine with another visualization type of your choosing (eg. bar chart) to create one cohesive visual in R; hint: hello, patchwork
