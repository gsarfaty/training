# Training Assignment

One of our treatment advisors has come to you for help. They need to see % TPT completion by psnu in South Africa for FY20Q4. Bonus if you can help them flag which psnus have a completion rate <85%

## Your job: 

* download the correct datasets (MER & geospatial)
* manipulate the MSD to create the TPT % completion metric for FY20Q4
* verify your values against another source (eg. Pano) to ensure they are correct
* map the data & combine with another visualization type of your choosing (eg. bar chart) to create one cohesive visual in R; hint: hello, patchwork
